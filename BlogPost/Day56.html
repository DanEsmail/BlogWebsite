          <p class="blogText">
            I have spend a little bit of time trying to figure out what I want out of workpost page. I want graphs and I already knew that. The big thing is to see my progress as I work out more and more. Something else that I want to see is my body fat percent and weight. I might at one point put in nutrition into this too. Then I&apos;ll have the whole kitten kapoodle. For now though I want to focus on a few things and not on everything. This is mostly due to me wanting to do about one hundred other things. Like I want to make my blog post pages look better. I even want to integrate things a little bit more seamlessly into my blog post. Right now though I have got the figma idea on paper and now I&apos;m going to try and execute it.
