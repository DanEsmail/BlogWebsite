          <p class="blogText">
            Now that we are starting to use Plotly more at work I need to fully understand how it works and what I&apos;m doing with it. What I have been learning so far is the layout and how to form a single app. The layout has two main sections. It has HTML elements and core components. These two things make the whole page.
          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            With the HTML section of the page. Dash has a method for each type of element within HTML. it has p elements divs, and anything else you can think of. Also when you declare one you can also set the attributes of the element. Also, the first argument within the method if nothing else is stated will be children. Within the children, elements will be all the nested elements within the method.
          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
The next thing that has to be mentioned is the core components. Anything within the core components will be the more advanced elements that you will use in the page. This could include things like graphs and dropdowns. This will be your bread and butter for creating visuals on the page.

          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            I&apos;m diving a little bit more into this within the week and will most likely be getting sidetracked by Plotly this week.
