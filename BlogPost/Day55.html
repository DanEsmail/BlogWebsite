          <p class="blogText">
            Now there is a lot of things that ES6 has added and the more I work with Javascript the more that I find I need to learn these things. I mean they are actually great  in a lot of ways. I have already been using a few of these things like classes, let, const, and now promises. I have taken some time to look at arrow functions, template literals, and default parameters. There is so much more to dig into and learn still after this.
          </p>
          <h4 class="sectionHeader">Arrow</h4>
          <p class="blogText">
            From what I have gathered this seems like a way to call an anonymous function. With it just using an arrow as a function. It looks like this (something) =&gt; returnvalue. It&apos;s a quick and easy way to clal anonymous functions.
          </p>
          <h4 class="sectionHeader">Template Literals</h4>
          <p class="blogText">
            What I can tell from these is that instead of the + operator variables can be called into strings by doing this ${variable}. This is greate because I&apos;m not going to have to write a million quotes.
          </p>
          <h4 class="sectionHeader">Default Parameters</h4>
          <p class="blogText">

This is one of my favorite since now you can have a default parameter. All this is saying is that an argument in a function can equal something if it isn&apos;t defined in the call. Say you had two parameters in a function name and age. When it gets called oops you forgot to add in your age. Well it doesn&apos;t matter if you have a default parameter on age of like 21. Then your age will be 21 in the function.
