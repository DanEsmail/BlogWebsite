          <p class="blogText">
            In the last few days/weeks, I have been working on two projects on and off with a lot of other power BI projects on my lap too. Where I won&apos;t address the Power BI projects I do want to address the two projects that I&apos;m working on and where I am at with them.

          <p class="blogText">
            First off how is the workout project going? Currently, I&apos;m done with the input page and I&apos;m testing it out and finding quality-of-life things that I want to add to it. I&apos;m also spending time data dopping into it. This will give me a good data set to work with while graphing the data.

          <p class="blogText">
            Taking about data how is the Plotly, dash, and flask project going? Well, it has been at a standstill and is going slow. We do have a temporary fix on multipage dashboards but we are trying to get things in a permit spot with the page registry. We are also deleting a lot of old code that we had. This code was from trying to build the flask section
