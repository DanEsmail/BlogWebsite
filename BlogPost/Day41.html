          <h3 class="title">Day 41: PHP update  </h3>

          <p class="blogText">
            For the final item on my to-do list with the workout post page, I needed to find a way to insert all the information from the work post HTML into the database. This is of course done with PHP and I have done a single row before but never anything on this kind of scale.
          </p>

          <h4 class="sectionHeader">The Project</h4>
          <p class="blogText">
            When working with PHP, JavaScript, and HTML I had a few issues but not a ton. One of the issues that I ran into was that if you use the disabled attribute for an input box it ends up blocking the PHP from reading. This caused a lot of confusion when I was trying to pull the date. I ended up changing my JavaScript a tiny bit to make up for this. All I had to do was delete where I had disabled it.
          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            The next thing was to build out the PHP. this had some issues but was relatively easy after doing a lot of testing. I found a good snippet of code that would give me all the keys when using the POST method with my PHP.
          </p>

          <h5 class="codeTitle">POST Keys</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
foreach ($_POST as $key =$gt; $value) { echo "Field ".htmlspecialchars($key)." is ".htmlspecialchars($value)."$lt;br$gt;"; }
            </code>
          </pre>


          <h5 class="codeTitle">PHP Code</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
$w_date = $_POST["W_date"];
$num_row = $_POST["work-rows"];
// Create connection

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if ($conn-$gt;connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn-$gt;connect_error);
}

for ($i=0; $i $lt; $num_row; $i++) {
  $exercise = $_POST["exercise-" . $i];
  for ($j=1; $j $lt; 6 ; $j++) {
    $x = $i*5+$j;

    $reps = $_POST["rep-" . $x];
    $weight = $_POST["weight-" . $x];
    if ($reps == ""){

    }else{
    $sql = "INSERT INTO `Workout_Table` (`id`, `Exercise`, `Rep`, `Weight`, `W_date`) VALUES (NULL, '{$exercise}', '{$reps}', '{$weight}', '{$w_date}')";


    if ($conn-$gt;query($sql) === TRUE) {
      echo "New Record Created Successfully";
    }else{
      echo "Error: " . $sql . "$lt;BR$gt;" . $conn-$gt;error;
    }
    }

  }
}


$conn-$gt;close();

            </code>
          </pre>

          <p class="blogText">
            After I found all the names for the form I was able to move on to the next part of the code that I needed to work on. I needed to create two for loops to access all the information from each block of the workout. This was to get the reps and weight for each. I know that five sets were the max that I allowed. Knowing let me do a little bit of math to get each input incrementally. After that, I could send the data to the database as long as the information wasn&apos;t blank.
          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            This isn&apos;t perfect and it&apos;s more of a proof of concept. I just wanted to have the ability to plot out some of my workout data so I can see my progress. Now I have to read up a ton on D3 and understand how to graph.
