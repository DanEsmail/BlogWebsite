          <h3 class="title">Day 17: A little Bit of PHP </h3>

          <p class="blogText">
            I have started to learn a little bit of php. Definitely not a ton of things to talk about today. I plan to use this PHP with the server to make accounts so everyone can comment on blog posts later down the road.

          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            When learning PHP I&apos;m realizing a lot of things are the same as Javascript and some things are different. Let&apos;s first talk about what&apos;s the same. A lot of ways that functions work are the same in php. They still use code blocks and curly braces. Also a lot of the simple functions like ifs and loops are also the same.
          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            Some of the differences that I noticed are variables, arrays, and constants. With variables needing a dollar sign in front of them to be defined. Contestants also need a defined function to be created. Finally arrays need to be called with an array function to be defined. These are some of the differences that have shown up.
          </p>

          <p class="blogText">
            The real thing that I think I&apos;m interested in and still reading up on are superglobals. These are the main variables for collecting information. There is a get and post super global that helps handle html forms. These will be the main driving factors of getting into PHP.
