          <h3 class="title">Day 30: CSS Frameworks </h3>

          <p class="blogText">
            As I continue on my journey I&apos;m getting to the point where I can&apos;t ignore the CSS frameworks as much as I use to. This doesn&apos;t mean that all of a sudden that I going to take all my vanilla CSS code and change to bootstrap. With that being said it would be a good idea for me to start researching some of the popular CSS Frameworks four that have sort of stood out to me and keep finding their way to my ears Bootstrap, tailwind, foundation, and Bulma. I&apos;m still in the middle of looking at all of these and you mind find that I style a page or two with there.
          </p>
          <p class="blogText">
            From what I have heard bootstrap is a great tool with not a lot of flexibility to it. It has some of the most responsive designs in it and it&apos;s massively popular. Now that being said foundation can be one of its biggest competitors. It is all massive but it has great flexibility. Now tailwind seems like something I&apos;m going to have to mess around with a lot to fully understand it. It seems like it has a bunch of great utility classes but the installation is interesting to me. Finally from what I have bread about Bulma, it is pretty easy to use and learn.

          </p>
          <p class="blogText">
            I&apos;ll be testing these out as I go along and try and find something to use all the time. I&apos;m also gearing up to work with PHP and forms. I have a project in the background looking for server information. Once that is up and ready I&apos;ll let everyone take look.
