          <h3 class="title">Day 31: Workout Project  </h3>
          <p class="blogText">
            Now that I have started to research a few more topics I have finally had an idea of what my next project will be. That project is a wait to visualize my workouts. I’m going to need to learn a lot of things to get this going the way that I want. Let me take you through what my thought process is and where I think I’m going to go with this.
          </p>
          <h4 class="sectionHeader">The idea</h4>
          <p class="blogText">
            Okay for the idea I think that I need a way to enter my workouts, reps, sets, and weights. Then from that data, I would like to have something spit out what my goal should be for the next workout and then have charts to show how I have been progressing. This will most likely have something to do with weight too. I have already started to work out how this is going to work on google sheets. I will take in the volume from having reps and weight get times by each other. I’ll have the system spit out a goal by seeing what my last workout was and how high I got.

          <h4 class="sectionHeader">The process</h4>
          <p class="blogText">
            Now to do this project I’m going to have to get familiar with a few things like PHP, SQL, databases, security, users, and more. I have already started to fiddle around with PHP with forms on my own so that will help. Plus I have to make SQL calls for work every day. That helps me get halfway there. For security, I want to add users to my website but I will have to make sure I’m the only one that can touch the database
