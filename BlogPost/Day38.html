          <h3 class="title">Day 38: Writing Help </h3>

          <p class="blogText">
            Today was another research day. I haven&apos;t been delivering the best content that I can. I just started, but that&apos;s not an excuse. I need to improve my writing. What did I do to remedy that, research. I checked out three blog posts about writing and they all pretty much said the same few things. They all said you need to have a basic concept of writing, and grammar, always read like it&apos;s your job, and just keep writing.
          </p>
          <p class="blogText">
            Having a basic concept of writing and grammar was a large part of what these writers were recommending. who can follow what you are saying when it makes no sense and everything is misspelled? They all recommend reading the book "elements of style" to improve your grammar and writing. Also when writing you will need to make sure you proofread what you write. It will never be perfect the first time you write something. give yourself time to come back and re-read what you wrote and check it over. That&apos;s definitely something I need to work on.
          </p>
          <p class="blogText">
            You also need to read constantly when you want to write for a living or get better at it. It&apos;s like anything. If you aren&apos;t watching what others are doing you don&apos;t know what&apos;s good or how to improve. If you played basketball but never saw someone dunk would you try it yourself or just shoot the jumper? It&apos;s been recommended to read the things that you are trying to write. trying to write a tech blog post then you should read tech blog posts to see what the writing style is. Also, read the things that you aren&apos;t writing. Maybe you want to bring something new to the space. It&apos;s always a good idea to be deep and wide when you work with a subject.
          </p>
          <p class="blogText">
            Also just write, you can&apos;t do anything well if you never do it. Even though I suck at writing I take time in my day and just practice putting out blog posts. No one ever started to write and was instantly the best writer out there. Just make sure to practice and make mistakes.
          </p>
          <p class="blogText">
            That&apos;s where I&apos;m at with writing but I&apos;ll keep getting better and putting out these blog posts
