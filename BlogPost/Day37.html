          <p class="blogText">
            More fun with python and work programming. The next few steps that we have to take care of are to deploy a Dash environment, pass the security users to the dashboards, and create dashboards. I need to tackle this one step at a time. What I&apos;m working on first is going to how to deploy dash pathways to create the different links to dash. Now, this was a task that was more research than anything else. I went through a few things and found out that I could build a layout on my home page and then from there could pass other python scripts to create our dashboard. This was very research dependant and I&apos;ll share some of the links to that on this page. Now with the creation of dash pages, we need to tie in the security that is what tomorrow will be
